                <p>The government is led by the Prime Minister, who selects all the remaining ministers. The prime minister and the other most senior<br /> ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the Cabinet.<br /> General elections are held every five years to elect a new House of Commons.<br /> As of 2015, the <b>Conservative party</b> is running the country.</p>
                <p>The current Prime Minister is <b>Theresa May.</b></p>

                <br />
                <p>The UK is a <b>democratic</b> country so nobody is above the law. About one hundred new laws are<br /> passed each year. A proposed new law is called <b>a bill</b>. Bills must be agreed by both Houses<br /> of Parliament and receive Royal Assent from the Queen before they can become Acts<br /> of Parliament which make our law.</p>
