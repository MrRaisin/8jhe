<h1>Snapchat Filters</h1>
<p>
Snapchat is used by 150 million people every day.Many people use the snapchat filters;you have to turn the camera facing you as if you were taking a selfie,then you hold on your face and the filters will appear.
To pick different filters you have to swipe across the bottom of the screen where the filters are and pick the one you wants to use, there are about 10 options.The most used filters are: the dog filter,the cpchelle flower child and the face swap.
Once you have taken the picture you can up load it on you story and it will stay there fro 24 hours then it will delete aoutomatically,or you can send it to a friend and one they open it, it will last only a few second,they can also replay yuor snaps or scrrenshot them, if someone screenshots your pictures it will say.
</p>You can also take videos of yuor self using the filters, while you are taking a video you can also turn the camera round to the other side.

</p> A new snapchat update allows u you to have a filter for your birthday.It will know when it's your birthday because when you get snapchat it asks for your date of birth and when it comes it will know.
